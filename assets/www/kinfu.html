I was born and raised in Dilla, small town in South part of Ethiopia. 
I went to Arba Minch University and Graduated with Civil Engineering in 2005. 
After my graduation, I started working in college for about one and half years. 
In 2007, I started working for Water works construction Enterprise, the biggest construction company in Ethiopia.  
In 2009, I got a scholarship from the Dutch government and went to the Netherlands to study my second degree in GIS 
and remote sensing. It was my first experience to travel outside my country.  
In 2011, I have come to the United States. Currently, I am doing my second master degree in computer Science. 
I am very happy enjoying the Computer Science.  
My future plan is to become a good software developer.
