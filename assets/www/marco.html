My name is Marco, I was born in Italy and grew up near Como, on the 
border with Switzerland. At age 22 I joined a local software company and 
started my computer career as network technician. It was the late 90s, 
Y2K was behind the corner, the Euro was about to be become the new 
currency, the IT business was thriving and I was enjoying working in a 
dynamic environment, with a good salary a relatively low stress. But 
eventually I  felt the need to get more education in order to boost my 
career. So I joined a local college to major in Computer Science. Two 
years into my college career, I had to opportunity to move to the states 
and to transfer to Maharishi University of Management (MUM). After 
graduation I worked in Fairfield as Web Developer, and once my visa 
expired I went back to my country where I spent 4 years working as 
contractor for different companies, mainly focusing on web development 
in PHP. In 2011 I had another opportunity to move to MUM, where I helped 
with the launch of a new website. In February 2012 I applied and I was 
accepted for their Master of Science in Computer Science.

My ideal job would involve working for a small company where I can wear 
different hats and switch between different tasks throughout the day: 
developing and maintaining new and existing applications (possibly web 
applications), perform routine jobs such as system administration, 
setting up backups, performing drills on such backups. I have good 
experience in prioritizing tasks and support requests, so I'd like to be 
a liaison for end users to submit their problems, which I will either 
solve myself or forward to the appropriate person.
