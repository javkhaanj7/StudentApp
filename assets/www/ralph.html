  <p>I was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the smallest state in Union. I have a younger brother. 
  My father was a postal clerk and my mother was a housewife.</p>
  <p>I stayed pretty much within the boundaries of Rhode Island until I was 18 when I took a
job in an airplane factory in Hartford, Connecticut. That did not
last long because the Army wanted me.</p>
<p> After getting out of the Army
I went to college on the GI Bill. I took my first programming course in 1968. It taught 
Fortran and I knew that I had found my calling. I still remember how
I felt after the lesson on arrays - now I could do anything with a computer!</p>
<p>The programming course led to a job as an operator of an IBM 360 mainframe
computer. I eventually worked as the third shift operator from midnight to 8am.
During that time I had to run jobs that were too big to run when the time-sharing
system was running. These "big" jobs required up to 512K of memory to run. The great
thing about the job was that when all the jobs had run, I had this multi-million
dollar computer to play with until the sun came up.</p>
<p>I still marvel at how fast computers have developed. These Android devices are much, much more powerful than
that mainframe computer.</p>
