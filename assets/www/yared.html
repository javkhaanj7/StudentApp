Here is a physics graduate lost in computer science world! 
Came to MUM with no more than for and while loop knowledge of computer science, 
every new block is one more new story for (not while though!) me.

Studied physics at Addis Ababa University twice, I taught physics at different 
levels for 8 years and worked as soccer journalist first as a freelancer, then as a full timer.

If I have to name my imaginary company, it would be numerical computers! 
Here is my reason for it: one of the challenges in the physical world is to make ideas and 
theories “visible” (or say understandable) for others. 
And this can be accomplished much easily with the help of mathematics and computer science.

As I’m a stranger for this field of study, right now I can’t say much about my ideal job. 
But I can imagine myself, after some transition period, working on something which really relates 
physics with computer science. But till then I believe working on android application is a 
good opportunity for me for two reasons, (i) as it’s relatively a new opportunity the 
gap(in terms of knowledge and experience ) I’ve wouldn’t  be as much as I’ve on the other positions, 
(ii) eventually there is a chance it may lead me to my imaginary job. 
That’s why I’m taking this course post ponding my initial plan of taking web architecture.
