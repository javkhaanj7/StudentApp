I was born in Briceni, which is a little and beautiful town in Moldova. 
There is a big forest near the town, so we have a clear and fresh air. 
I like the place where I was born but I had to leave it after I graduated school, because I wanted to go to university, 
which is located in the capital of Moldova. 
I had good score after school, so I paid no tuition for my education at university. 
I spent four years studying there. When I was in my third year teaching I found a job , because I didn’t want to depend on parents. 
The first job I got was network administrator. I liked that job , but I felt like that not what I want to do, 
so after about eight months I left that job. 
After I graduate university I was looking for another job and it was too hard to get hired, 
because I didn’t have enough experience, but after a couple of months I got it. 
It was my first experience in programming. It was really interesting project for me, 
I had to make a web site for a big company. In 2010 I learned from my friend about Maharishi University and 
I decided that I want to study there, because it would give me a lot of knowledge, a lot of experience, 
so I could find a better job . 
I had sent an application to MUM , but received an answer that I didn’t have enough experience in Computer Science. 
And after about two years of working in corresponding area I applied again and I was accepted. 
So now I’m studying at MUM on MS Computer Science program.

About ideal job for me is to have my own company, which develops software.
