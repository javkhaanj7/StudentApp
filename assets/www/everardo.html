My first contact with information technology was at High School, algorithms and programming with Pascal 
were the starting point, from that I decided to pursue it as a career, so I went to college where my knowledge was
 enriched with other technologies such as C, C++, PHP and ASP and graduated as Computer Systems Engineer.
An opportunity for a practical training came to me with one of the biggest government agencies, 
after 6 months the full time position was offered to me in the information department, 
where one of my main functions was to improve the way the Department process requests for State services from residents. 
The company kept me for 7 years in a consultant role until September 2011.
During 2011, my priority was pursuing a new project where I could master some skills that I was working out besides my job; 
those were my SCJP certification, my English skills and a desire for new experiences, 
my first step was to measure my skills in some advances skills, so this led me to take the TOEFL and GRE as starting point, 
and they eventually were the mean to know about and apply for MUM, I joined the student group in October 2011.
Now I look to getting a position as Business Analyst, that has been my role as professional in the past 
and plan to continue, in addition to my past development, the experience at MUM has improved several fields in me at 
personal and professional scale, for the future I would like to pursue a managerial position, 
I’m sure the combination of my previous role plus the training during the last year make the perfect match to make it real.
