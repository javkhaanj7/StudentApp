  <p>My name is Javkhlantugs Nyamdorj. I was born and raised in Ulaanbaatar, is the capital city of Mongolia.</p>
  <p>I was playing computer game a lot before enter university. I think that is my reason why I chose this Software Engineering major.</p>
  <p>I got my Bachelor’s degree at university of Computer Science and Management School in Ulaanbaatar, in 2009. 
  During that time I am also interested about computer hardware which is more interested about Robots.</p>
<p>After my undergraduate education, I decided to learn more about hardware then I came to Japan and became a research student of University of Nagoya. 
When I was a research student, I was preparing for exams to enter graduate course.</p>
<p>But I failed the exams several times. After my visa expired, I returned to my country in end of 2010.</p>
<p>Then I became employee at ISP Company in my country. I worked 2 years in Software Engineering position and gained lot of experiences. 
Now I am really appreciated to learning master course in Computer Science at MUM.</p>
<p>The location where people are cooperative  and the job which gives me self satisfaction is my ideal job.</p>
